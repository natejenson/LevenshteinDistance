# Levenshtein Edit Distance & Optimal Alignment

Use the Levenshtein Distance algorithm to determine the edit distance between two input strings. The program will also output the optimal alignment of the two strings.


#### How to use
The program takes a single command line argument, which should be a path to an input file. The input file should contain two lines, each containing a string to be used in the edit distance calculation.
